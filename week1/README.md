## Project Overview

This project is a simple text-based adventure game written in Python.

The goal of the game is to make choices that lead the player to either a win or a loss.  
The game uses variables, conditionals, and functions to control game flow and outcomes.

---

## How the Game Works

- The player is presented with a scenario.
- The player makes choices using text input.
- The program uses conditional logic to determine what happens next.
- The game ends in either a win or a loss.

---

## Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the following concepts:

- Variables and data types
- User input using `input()`
- Output using `print()`
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Functions to organize code

---

## How to Run the Program

1. Open a terminal in the `week1` folder.
2. Run the following command:

python text_adventure.py

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

---

## Design Notes

Briefly describe your game:

- What is the setting? 
- What choices does the player make? 
- What determines a win or loss? 

(Write 3–5 sentences.)

The game is based on one punch man. The two choices the player can make are; to throw a punch or to leave the monster alone. The first option is the win because you do not want to leave the monster to kill civilians.

## Known Issues or Limitations

List any bugs, missing features, or things you would improve if you had more time.

If there are none, write:  
`None`

I was thinking of putting a bit more dialog and Wish I could have made more options that give more story.

## Reflection

Answer the following:

- What part of this project was the most challenging?
- What concept do you feel most confident about after completing this?

(2–4 sentences total.)

The most challening part of this project for me was functions. I cant fully understand how they work yet but still got it to work while looking at w3.
I get the structure of how to build and make it work but don't really understand what the code In it means. If i were to do it on my own, id probably forget.
