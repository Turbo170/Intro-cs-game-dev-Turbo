What does the player do repeatedly?
What is the main goal?
What causes the player to lose?
Why is the loop engaging?

Arcane odessey. There are a lot of things the player can de repeatedly like cooking, fishing, bounty hunting, diving, etc.
But the main goal/ repeatedly actions the player does, follow the story quest, level up to max level, get the best armor, 
and finalize a build to then create another build or "100%" one. A player mostly loses from npcs attackingthem, or 
attending duels with players. If you count losing as "dying" there are other things like drowning in water or dying to a tornado.
The loop is engaging because its made to keep the player constantly look for something that gives them interest. 
The loop also gives the player a reward every time you finish the loop. An Example of this is levels, a player wants levels?
Then they can do the story or look around for npc quests. Once finishing the quest, you get the levels you wanted with some money.
So Player looks for quest, finishes said quest, is given reward of exp and money.
