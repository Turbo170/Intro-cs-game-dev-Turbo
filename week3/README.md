RPG Game Description
Describe how your RPG-lite game works:

How is the player represented using a dictionary?
How are enemies represented?
How does combat work?
What determines a win or loss?

(Write 4–6 sentences.)

My Dictionary is pretty simple, I have only the player and the enemy. both have keys for their name and heath. For the combat, all you have to do
is press enter, then it will provide you with breif statements of whats going on between the two fighters. The win or loss is determined by whoever
reaches 0 health points first.

File Structure Explanation
Briefly explain what each file is responsible for:

main.py
characters.py
character_dict.py
inventory.py

(1–2 sentences per file.)

The main.py file is where I keep 90 percent of my code, basically the brain. Characters.py is where i keep the dictionary for the Player and enemy. Chracter_dict.py
is where I tested different code with dict(). Inventory.py is where i practiced using dict(), its just to show an inventory being used to create a potion.

Design Decisions
Describe any design decisions you made:

Why did you use dictionaries instead of lists or variables?
How did splitting code into multiple files help?
Did you reuse logic from Week 2?

(3–5 sentences.)

I used dictionaries instead of lists or variables so I can be familiar with it later on when doing coding for an inventory system. Splitting the code into multiple
files helps with being a lot more organized. I definitely looked over my week 2 a lot, refeshes the mind.

Reflection
Answer the following:

What was the hardest concept this week?
What part of your program structure are you most confident in?
How did using multiple files change how you think about writing programs?

(4–6 sentences total.)

The hardest concept used will probably still be functions, I used it a lot more this time while including a dictionary. The best part I have made will probably be
including random.randint into a the function that works perfectly with my dictionary. It may be simple but It took me a while to figure it out. Using multiple files
on this assignment allows me to expand on the idea of being tidey. It gives you a lot of options on where to put stuff and will later on be helpful when looking for
specific code to add, edit, and remove.
